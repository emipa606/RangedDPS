  <!-- EN: The average amount of damage this turret can deal for every unit of resource used for ammo or barrel replenishment, including missed shots.  Higher values mean the turret is more resource-efficient at dealing damage.\n\nThis stat refers to the actual amount of raw resources used, not the amount of "barrel durability" used up.  E.g., for a turret that is rearmed with steel, this is how much damage you get out of 1 unit of steel.  It does not account for the resources used to build the turret, only the resources used when the turret shoots. -->
